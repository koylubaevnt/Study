	/**
	 * If you're new to linked lists, this is a great exercise for learning about them. Given a 
	 * pointer to the head node of a linked list, print its elements in order, one element per line. 
	 * If the head pointer is null (indicating the list is empty), donâ€™t print anything.
	 * 
	 * Input Format
	 * The void Print(Node* head) method takes the head node of a linked list as a parameter. Each 
	 * struct Node has a data field (which stores integer data) and a next field (which points to 
	 * the next element in the list).
	 * Note: Do not read any input from stdin/console. Each test case calls the Print method 
	 * individually and passes it the head of a list.
	 * 
	 * Output Format
	 * Print the integer data for each element of the linked list to stdout/console (e.g.: using 
	 * printf, cout, etc.). There should be one element per line.
	 * 
	 * Sample Input
	 * This example uses the following two linked lists:
NULL
1->2->3->NULL
	 * and are the two head nodes passed as arguments to Print(Node* head).
	 * Note: In linked list diagrams, -> describes a pointer to the next node in the list.
	 * 
	 * Sample Output
	 * 1
	 * 2
	 * 3
	 * 
	 * @param args
